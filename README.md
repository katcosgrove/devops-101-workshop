# Workshop: DevOps 101

Maintained by: Kat Cosgrove, kat.cosgrove@gmail.com, @dixie3flatline

Hi Workshop!


## Course Description


When you’re new to an industry, you encounter a lot of new concepts. This can make it really difficult to get your feet underneath you on an unfamiliar landscape, especially for junior engineers. What does DevOps really mean? What’s all this software? What’s all this jargon? Is DevOps a methodology, or a toolset? Is any of this actually going to make my life easier, or is it just a bunch of industry buzzwords? I’ll answer all of these questions (and more) during this hands-on workshop, and get you set up with an end-to-end DevOps solution to automate your build artifact storage, vulnerability detection, testing, and deployment. For profit and glory!


## Skill Level: Beginner

Attendees do not need to be experts in or have experience using any of the technologies or pre-requisites involved in conducting this workshop, aside from a functional understanding of Git and GitHub. The intended audience is people still in school, junior developers, or anyone from a technical or tech-adjacent background who has no hands-on experience with DevOps practices and tooling.


## Prerequisites

1. [JFrog Cloud account](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/start-free/#saas)

    This is free, no credit card required. It includes access to Artifactory, Pipelines, and Xray, with a limited amount of storage, transfer, and build minutes. NOTE: To follow this workshop, you must choose either AWS or Azure as your cloud provider. JFrog Pipelines is not currently available on GCP.

2. Docker

    The Docker client should be installed and configured on your machine.

3. Python3

    We will need to package a simple Python application. Python 3.6 or higher is required.

4. Git + GitHub
    A GitHub account is required so that you can fork this repository, and Git must be configured in your terminal.

5. Code editor

    Whatever you are most comfortable with. I will be using SublimeText.
